Underscore.strings.httpize.js
==============================

What is Underscore.strings.httpize.js?
--------------------------------------

This little script is an extension for Underscore.strings.js, and hence Underscore.js, a great Javascript utility library.

It makes use of the startsWith function included with Underscore.strings, allow you to add http:// to the front of strings where doing so is desirable. Before it does this, it uses startsWith to check if http:// is already present. Once it has done it (or not as the case may be!), it returns the result.

How do I use it?
----------------

A full usage example is included in example.html. In short, you need to include underscore.js, underscore.strings.js and underscore.strings.httpize.js (preferably in that order) and then run _.httpize(string_to_httpize). Or you can use the alternative syntax of _(string_to_httpize).httpize().
